# 🦠 Malaria Detection using CNN

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **Scikit-learn** to detect malaria-infected blood cells from images. The goal is to build an accurate and efficient model to assist in medical diagnosis.

## 🔬 Project Overview

Malaria is a life-threatening disease, and early detection is key to treatment. In this project, I:

- Preprocess a dataset of labeled cell images (infected vs. uninfected)
- Build a CNN model using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Visualize training progress over epochs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python
- 🧠 TensorFlow & Keras
- 📊 Scikit-learn
- 📁 Pandas, NumPy

---

## 📊 Dataset

We used the **Malaria Cell Images Dataset** from the NIH:  
> https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-publications/pubs/MalariaDatasets.html

The dataset contains images of infected and uninfected cells, labeled accordingly.
